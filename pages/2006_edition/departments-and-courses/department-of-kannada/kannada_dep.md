### Department of Postgradute Studies and Research in Kannada

### Brief History

It is the great fortune of the local people that on the first of August 1957
the Department of Kannada was opened along with the starting of the Government
College Kasaragod. It is a matter of pride that the department has grown
steadily over the years. Prof. P. Subraya Bhat was the first Head of the
department. Dr. B.K. Thimmappa, Dr. P. Krishna Bhat, Dr. U. Shankaranarayana
Bhat, Prof. B. Padmanabha, Prof. M. Vimala Rajakumari, Prof. B. Venugopala
Bhat and Prof. P.N. Moodithaya were some of the earlier staff members of the
staff. In 1963 Kannada Language & Literature under part III was introduced and
P.G. course was started in 1969. The 20th Anniversary of the Department was
celebrated in the year 1990. The silver jubilee of the department was
celebrated in the year 1995. It became a research centre in 1990, and was
inaugurated by Dr. M.K. Prasad, the then Pro-Vice Chancellor of Calicut
University. At present there are six research scholars.

From 1984 onwards the department has arranged many activities in association
with ‘Kasaragodu Kannada Balaga (R), Vidyanagara’. Every year special Guest
lectures are conducted in commemoration of the two late Professors, P. Subraya
Bhat and Dr. B.K. Thimmappa. The department has, on various occasions,
honoured eminent persons like Sheni Gopalakrishna Bhat (Yakshagana artist), P.
Venkataraja Puninchathaya (Tulu scholar), Ms. Indira, Krishna Master (Award
winning teachers), Kasaragodu Chinna(Cine actor) and Amrith Someshwara. During
the last ten years different seminars were organised on various topics under
the sponsorship of UGC, Department of Kannada & Culture and Various Academies
of Karnataka. In 1989 ‘D.V.G. Darshana’ a collection of critical essays was
published by the department. There has been good participation in these
seminars by the students and members of the public. Cultural study tours were
arranged. The department was actively involved in the extension work during
the X plan at Panchayath levels.

Two refresher courses for the college teachers were conducted. “Kannada
Dhwani” a periodical is being published by students under the guidance of the
department. The alumni of the department have achieved distinction in various
walks of life especially in the field of art and literature. Some of the
teachers of this department have presented papers in the National Seminars and
published their own books, and articles in reputed journals. Six Research
Scholars obtained Ph.D. Degree through this department. This is the only
department which provides P.G. studies and Research in Kannada in the whole
State of Kerala.
