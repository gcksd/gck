### Research Activities

  * Area: Harmonic Analysis/Theory of frames
  * Presented papers and delivered invited talks in various regional and National Seminars.
  * Completed the Minor Research Project entitled "Weyl-Heisenberg Frames" sanctioned by the University Grants Commission as per MRP(S) - 886/10-11/KLKA014/UGC-SWRO / 16-03- 2011 on 30-11-2012. In this project, a useful characterization of Weyl - Heisenberg Frame Operators on the space L2(R) is obtained and published in the article "A characterisation of Weyl-Heisenberg Frame Operators" (co-authored with K.Parthasarathy,(Bull.Sci.math.(2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bulsci.2012.09.001.)
