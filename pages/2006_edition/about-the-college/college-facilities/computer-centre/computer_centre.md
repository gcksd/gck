The fully equipped centralised Computer Laboratory which was established in
2001-02. The maintenance of the computers, the purchase of stationery,
improvement of infrastructure etc. are also done by the PTA. A nominal amount
is collected from the beneficiaries for meeting part of the expense. The local
MLA Sri. C. T. Ahamed Ali has sanctioned a sum of Rs.2, 00, 000/- for the
establishment of the centre in 2003. Member of the Parliament from Kasaragod,
Sri. P. Karunakaran has sanctioned an amount of Rs. 2, 00,000 for the up
gradation of the computer lab during 2004-05.

Apart from giving curricular instructions in computer science to students, a
computer awareness programme is conducted during leisure hours, and also after
the class hours. Care is taken to see that all the students of the College
achieve a certain level of computer proficiency before they complete their
course. The centre has adequate facility to help the students in preparing
assignments, seminar papers and project reports.
