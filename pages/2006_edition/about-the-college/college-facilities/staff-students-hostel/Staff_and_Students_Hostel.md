### Staff Quarters

Staff quarters were constructed and to a certain extent we were able to solve
the problem of accommodation of teachers appointed from far off places. At
present thirty-two quarters are available for accommodation under the
following categories:

  * Type I
    * 8 Numbers
  * Type II
    * 10 Numbers
  * Type III
    * 10 Numbers
  * Type IV
    * 2 Numbers
  * Type V
    * 2 Numbers
  * Total
    * 32 Numbers

### Hostels

The girl’s hostel was inaugurated by General Kariappa. It can accommodate
fifty students. Due to great demand nearly 100 students are accommodated in
the hostel every year. We have approached the authorities to build new
additional blocks. The construction work of a Post metric hostel for girls
attached to the present one has already commenced, and it is expected to admit
an additional number of 90 students.

  
Boy’s hostel was inaugurated in the college campus on 17.10.84 by Sri. T. M.
Jacob, the then Minister for Education. The capacity of the hostel was 99
students. There was a big ground in front of hostel for sports and exercise
for the students. A few years later, due to constructional problems it was
declared unfit for occupation. Later a rented building was taken where 25
students were able to get admission. Now college has a new hostel with 25
student occupants. Sri. Thomas Antony ,Lecturer in Botany, is the resident
tutor.
