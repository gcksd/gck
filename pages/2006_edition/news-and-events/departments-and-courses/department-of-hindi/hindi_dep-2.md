# Department Profile

Brief History  
  
The Department of Hindi has been functioning since the inception of the
College in August 1957. At that lime, there was only one year Pre- University
Course affiliated to the Kerala University which was replaced by the two years
Pre-Degree Course in 1964. As far as Hindi is concerned, till now there is no
degree course in Hindi and it has been taught only as the second language for
the Degree Courses. At the beginning, one teacher was sufficient to engage the
classes in Hindi, later the number was raised to three, when the shift batches
for the Pre-degree were started. As a result of the de linking of the Pre-
degree course from the College, once again the number of teacher was reduced
to one and thus now it is a single member department. Presently, the
department is responsible for conducting the second language classes for
twelve degree courses (five arts subjects and seven science subjects)
comprising 213 students with in a limit of 22 hours in a week by a single
staff member.  
  
During this long period many eminent and efficient teachers have rendered
their valuable service for the development and reputation of the department as
well as of the college. K.M. Govindan Nambesan, M.S. Radhakrishna Pillai, K.
Jayadevan and C.P. Jayasagar are the most renowned persons in the beginning
and Smt, Salhi, Smt. Ramla Beevi, K. Krishna Pillai, Sathyanesan and Smt. Usha
B. Nair also are the names to be remembered with gratitude. Prof. K.M.
Govindan was a good organizer. It is during his time that the department built
a good library. He retired from the service as the Deputy Director of
Collegiate Education. Prof. Jayadevan was an efficient social worker who has
worked as the programme co-coordinator of the N.S.S. units all over Kerala. On
deputation he has served as the programme coordinator of the NSS units of the
northern region of India too for many years. Smt. Usha B. Nair also was a good
organizer. She was the member of the Kasaragod Peoples Forum and served as
Vice President of the same. As the Fine arts Advisor of the College, she has
accompanied the students enabling them to participate in the Zonal Competition
related with Fine Arts Festival, in the ‘Mathrubhoomi Kalotasavam’ at Kannur
and in the Yuvavani Programme of the Akashavani, Kannur. She has published
several articles in “Sangrathan” a magazine, published by Hindi Vidya Peeth,
Kerala.
