# Department Profile

The department came into existence with the establishment of the college in
1957 with one year Pre-University Course which was later replaced by two year
Pre-Degree scheme. Degree course with Physics as subsidiary subject was
offered in 1962 for the BSc Geology course. Later Physics as subsidiary
subject was opted for the BSc courses in Mathematics, Chemistry and Computer
Science. Degree course with Physics as the main subject was introduced in the
year 1965.

The Department of Physics is one of the leading part of the college with many
of its alumni reaching good career positions in India and abroad. Many of our
alumnis work in academic, R&D, and other luminous careers in the society. The
department showcased a very good result in the 2006-'07 Kannur University
examinations with a hundred percent pass result with one student bagging the
second Rank in the University for BSc Physics.
