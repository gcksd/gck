# Humanitarian Cell

During the last couple of years we lost some of our dear students and devoted
colleagues. Some of them died in accidents and some of them due to fatal and
chronic illness. Our office Superintendent Vasanthamadhava, and Peon G.
Gopalan died of cancer. K. V. Chandrashekaran, Lecturer in Economics died of
brain hemorrhage and our former Commerce Lecturer K. M. Thomas lost his life
in a road accident. One of our students, M. K. Kishorekumar, third year BA
Kannada was suffering from suspected Blood Cancer. Another student Sheeja,
second year BSc. Zoology, who was suffering from chronic congenital cardiac
ailment. In all these cases the Humanitarian Cell raised sufficient funds from
among the staff and students and rendered them financial help. Dr. Kamalaksha
was the convener for collecting financial assistance to Vasanthamadhava while
he was in office as Senior Superintendent. Rs.1, 00,000.00 was collected for
his treatment and family welfare fund.

Similarly when G. Gopalan was suffering from blood cancer a sum of Rs.50000.00
was collected for his treatment and a similar amount was handed over to his
family after his demise. Dr. V. Gopinathan was the convener. In both these
cases financial support was also extended by our former colleagues who were
transferred from this institution and working in other places. All these
collections were made with permission from Higher Authorities. Collections
were made from staff members only.

In Kishorekumar’s case he was having suspected Leukemia and his family was not
able to meet the expenditure for treatment at Bangalore. We collected an
amount of Rs.20000.00 for his treatment. Fortunately, after a comprehensive
checkup in Bangalore, he was found to have problem.

In Sheeja’s case, the family was very poor and belonged to SC category. She
was suffering from chronic congenital cardiac ailment which required immediate
surgical intervention as advised doctors at Pariyaram Medical College. The
surgery required an amount of Rs.65, 000.00. Her fellow students collected an
amount of Rs.10, 915.00 from among themselves and handed over to the
Principal. The PTA gave a loan of Rs.40000.00, and an amount of Rs.25000.00
was made available by the Harijan Welfare department. The amount given by the
PTA was later reimbursed by the staff members. The surgery has already been
done and she is recovering now.  
When on December 26th the tsunami struck the coastal areas of Kerala and
thousands lost their lives and property, the staff members contributed a day’s
salary to the Chief Ministers tsunami relief fund.
