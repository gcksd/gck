# Staff Club

### ![](assets/2006/picture/upload/image/staff2013-2.gif)

Staff Club is a cultural forum of the teaching staff of the college. It is
envisaged to facilitate literary, cultural and artistic interaction among its
members. Seminars and debates are arranged on issues of contemporary interest,
ensuring the participation of students also. Social get-togethers are arranged
on important occasions like Ramzan, Onam, Christmas, etc. Competitions in
Sports and Games are conducted for the members and prizes are distributed on
the annual day. The annual day is celebrated in a befitting manner with
cultural programmes by the members and their families. The club arranges
farewell functions to teachers who retire from service. The club is very
active in all the general developmental activities of the college. It gives
full support to artistically talented students to develop their skills.
Financial assistance is given to needy and deserving students. When teachers
are transferred from other institutions and when new postings are made the
club helps them to find suitable accommodation. Through various activities the
club helps to foster fraternal feeling among the members. Some of the non
teaching staff also associates with the activities of the club. Every year
elected representatives of the staff members form the executive committee with
a President and a Secretary. Various common requirements are met by the staff
club. A poor student aid fund VIDYANIDHI was instituted by the staff members
with a view to help poor students who are brilliant in their studies.

Present President(2012-13): Dr. Mercy Joseph, Department of Statistics

Present Secretary(2012-13): Prof. Manoj Chathoth, Department of Economics
