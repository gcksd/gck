# National Service Scheme (NSS)

The NSS Unit was introduced in this college in 1969. The aim of NSS is to
promote national consciousness and a sense of social responsibility,
discipline and dignity of labour and to help students to develop their
personality. NSS special camps are arranged during December every year. More
than hundred boys and girls participate in the camps. Rural areas are selected
for community service and educational programmes. Besides the annual camp,
regular works in the college campus are also undertaken. Students who attend
the camp are given a certificate and are eligible for grace marks for seeking
admission to higher courses. At present there are two units attached to the
Kannur University.

### Achievements

  * The National Service Scheme (NSS) of this college has been doing remarkable work during the last five years. The unit has been in the forefront of all the activities in the college and has offered many selfless services to the society. The NSS units have already bagged 6 State awards, 16 University awards during the last five years for their community service and enterprising attitude. Apart from the incessant regular activities in the campus, the units organise many community contact programmes in and outside the campus. The NSS plays a large role in making the students socially committed, selfconfident and responsible citizens of the nation. It would be pertinent to note that the committed efforts by the enterprising programme officers of the NSS, Mohammed Ali .K and Rathnakara ., took the NSS units to exceptional achievements during the last five years. The support given by the NSS to the anti-endosulfan movement and the activities it did to augment the struggle were applauded by many all over the state. The units have taken Enmakaje Grama Panchayath (The Endosulfan affected panchayat) as their adopted village for the last four years.
