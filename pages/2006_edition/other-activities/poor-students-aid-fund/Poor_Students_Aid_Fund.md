# Poor Students Aid Fund

Every year PSAF is distributed among the needy students based on the
verification conducted by a committee constituted by the Principal. At the
time of admission, a nominal amount is collected from each student as part of
their fees as per Government direction. This amount thus collected goes to the
PSAF. In the year 2004-05 there was an amount of Rs.25000.00 in the fund,
which was distributed at the rate of Rs.700.00 to ten PG students and at the
rate Rs.400.00 to forty five UG students. This aid is given to only those
students who are not in receipt of any scholarships, and whose parental income
is less than Rs. 24000.00 per annum. Applications from various departments are
scrutinized in the department level itself based on academic and financial
condition.
