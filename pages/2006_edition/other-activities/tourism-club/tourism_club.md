# Tourism Club

A tourism club has been functioning in Government College Kasaragod since
2002-03. There are 50 members in the club. Two student co-coordinators were
nominated. Sreemathykutty. K. (Department of Geology)  is working as the
Convenor of the tourism club. Various functions are organized by the tourism
club. A financial assistance of Rs. 2500.00 was released to the center for the
club activity by the District Tourism Promotion Council, Kasaragod.

Various meetings and discussions were held on promotion of eco tourism. The
club members have decided to minimize the use of plastics in the campus and
keep the campus clean and green. Pamphlets were distributed among students to
highlight the tourist spots in the district. A nature study camp was arranged.
The visit to Manasa Water theme park and adjoining landscape in Mangalore
attracted all the members. Many members of the club participated in
environmental awareness campaign, like protection of river, rainwater
harvesting and Environmental Day celebrations.
