# Old Students' Association

The Old Students Association was formed as early as 1964 when the enthusiastic
old students of the college came forward to form a body to maintain their
relation with their alma-mater. Advocate I.V. Bhat, Advocate P.A Hameed, Prof.
Chapady Vasudeva, K.P Jayarajan (Presently Controller of Examinations, Kannur
University) have played a significant role in forming the association. The
Association had been doing good work in serving as a link between the college
and the public in academic and other allied matters. But after 1969, its
activities came to a standstill. It was revived again in 1982 when the
authorities decided to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of the college on its
completion of 25 years in August 1982. The Association played a commendable
role in the silver Jubilee celebrations. Various literary and cultural
competitions were conducted. The sports for old students was inaugurated by
Sri K.P. Nooruddin, the then Minister for sports. The Exhibition arranged in
connection with the silver Jubilee was a grand success. A “Remembrance
Meeting” and get-together of old students also was held. Cash prizes,
scholarships and endowments for the benefit of poor and talented students were
instituted. The association used to meet regularly since then, and render all
possible work in the developmental activities of the college.  
An extensive general body was convened on 9.3.2003 to ensure its active
involvement in preparing the college for NAAC accreditation. A comprehensive
project report was prepared in order to submit the same to the authorities
concerned for early execution. The works include:

  1. Completion of compound wall
  2. Asphalting of the approach roads to the College
  3. Gardening
  4. Repair of electric fittings
  5. Repair of toilets
  6. Renovation and furnishing of the College Auditorium.
  7. Up gradation of Labs.
  8. A separate Computer centre
  9. Construction of boy’s hostel.

Many of the above works have been completed now with the prompt response from
the PWD and other Govt. Departments. The OSA spent nearly Rs. 20000.00 for the
construction and repair of compound walls in various parts of the campus. An
amount of rupees Two lakhs was donated by Sri. Abdul Quadir, Theruvath, a
distinguished old student for the renovation and furnishing of the Auditorium.
An overseas unit of the OSA was formed in UAE under the initiative of the old
students there. We have requested them to consider the construction of a
separate computer block.  
  
It is commendable to note that a good number of the members of the teaching
staff in various departments of the college are old students and members of
the association. P.V Madhavan Nair, Principal and the President of the OSA is
an old student of the college. The OSA associates itself with the College
authorities and the PTA in all the activities of the College. We try to
maintain contact with all the old students of the College, who can contribute
to the welfare of the institution.
