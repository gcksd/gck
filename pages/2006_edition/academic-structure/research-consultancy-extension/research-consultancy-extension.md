# Research, Consultancy & Extension

![](assets/2006/picture/upload/image/academics/research_learning.jpg)Research activity is
encouraged among teachers by providing financial support and study leave. Most
of the staff members of various departments have either arranged seminars in
their respective departments and/or have participated in national and
international seminars. Some of them have published books and research papers.
Efforts of the departments of English, Economics, Kannada, Statistics, Geology
and Chemistry are of particular mention. This trend has been promoted in other
departments as well. The Chemistry, Kannada, Geology and English departments
have initiated effort to take up research projects. In a couple of departments
there are recognized research guides. There are three part-time research
scholars working for their doctorate degree in Kannada and one in Statistics
departments.

Some of the departments are having teachers with research degrees and vast
experience, which make a strong case for the authorities to explore avenues
for offering consultancy services, especially in Geology and Chemistry
departments. When water scarcity and environmental degradation are the main
problems in the area such a link will be fruitful.

The teachers and students of the college participate in extension activities
under the banner of NSS in collaboration with Governmental and Non-
Governmental Organizations. NSS unit has adopted a number of programmes. NCC
activities are also worth mentioning. Some of the old students got
Commissioned Officer placements in Indian Army/Air Force. Many cadets joined
the Armed Forces of the nation and some of the cadets participated in the
Republic Day celebration in the recent past. Several of the cadets have
obtained ‘B’ and ‘C’ certificates of NCC. Sports activities are encouraged by
the college and many of the students have got prizes in the university and
state level competitions.
