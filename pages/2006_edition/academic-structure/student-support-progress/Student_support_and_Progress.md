support to the Principal in maintaining discipline. Academic programmes are
monitored frequently. Internal tests, seminars, discussions etc encourage the
students. The internal assessment is very effective in analyzing the various
skills and academic standards of students. The tutorial system is helpful in

departments have produced such outstanding students who have been a great
inspiration for the others to strive for the best. The placement cell gives
the necessary advice and motivation to the students to find good placements.

students, irrespective of their social background, are getting concession on

admission, examination and discipline. All the necessary student support
information is given there.
