# Teaching Learning Evaluation

![](assets/2006/picture/upload/image/academics/learning_evo.jpg)The college has
constituted an Admission Committee in each subject and admissions are given
based on the student performance in the qualifying examination. After
admitting the students, those found lagging behind in studies are identified
and given remedial coaching. On the other hand, advanced learners are given
individual attention and encouraged to strive for their goals. The pattern of
examination and the evaluation returns are informed to the students well in
advance. Individual teachers prepare time bound annual teaching plan. Teachers
follow conventional teaching methods; whenever necessary they are supplemented
by the use of slide projectors, over-head projectors and audio-visual aids.
Syllabus is unitized and strict time frame is adhered to in completing the
same before the end of the academic year leaving time for revision.  
The recruitment of faculty is made by PSC and the state government. The state
government sanctions the teaching positions on the basis of the number of
students admitted and workload. The college has the freedom to appoint guest
faculty on hourly basis, as per need.  
It is mandatory for the teachers to prepare Teacher’s Diary and keep it ready
for evaluation of staff performance. Majority (75%) of the classes are engaged
by the full time faculty. Systematic effort is made to assess the students’
performance and the feedback of the same is made available to the students.

Recruitment of about 25% of the teaching staff on hourly basis against vacant
positions is necessitated due to the State Government policy of ban on new
appointments during the last few years. In some departments, like English and
Languages, the teacher-student ratio is rather unfavourable. Steps are being
taken to appoint teachers so as to keep this ratio at a reasonable level. The
student drop-out is normally due to engineering/medical/other professional
course admissions. Most of the members of the teaching staff have participated
in seminars, conferences/workshops at National/ International level. The
departments of Chemistry, Kannada, Geology, Mathematics, English, Arabic and
Physics have organized seminars during last year. The science departments have
organized study tours. Geology department is actively involved in
environmental awareness campaigns in association with NGOs. Kannada Department
is actively involved in organizing literary programme.

  
The college periodically assesses the students to evaluate them. Assignments
and seminars which form an integral part of the evaluation methodology enable
the teachers to assess the students. There is provision for internal
assessment. The college conducts model examination to orient the students for
the final examination, which is designed and conducted by the affiliating
university. Faculty evaluation is through self-appraisal forms submitted
annually.
