# Search Website

To enter a query, type in a few descriptive words and press the Enter key or
click the Search button for a list of relevant results.

The search engine uses sophisticated text-matching techniques to find pages
that are both important and relevant to your search. For instance, it analyzes
not only the candidate page, but also the pages linking into it to determine
the value of the candidate page for your search. It also prefers pages in
which your query terms are near each other.
